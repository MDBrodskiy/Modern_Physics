    \section{Basic Properties of Atoms}

  \item Around 1900, knowledge about atoms was:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Size: Small, $1[\si{\angstrom}]/.1[\si{\nano\meter}]$

      \item Stable: Forces balance

      \item Atoms contain electrons ($e^-$) and maintain neutral charge

      \item Atoms can emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Scattering Experiments and the Thomson Model}

  \item An early atom model: J.J. Thomson (1904):

    \section{The Rutherford Nuclear Atom}

  \item Rutherford discovered two rays, $\alpha$ and $\beta$-rays, which he used to experiment with atoms

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\alpha$ rays are essentially \ce{He^2+} atoms

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The positive charge would mean that the atoms should deflect $\alpha$ rays

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Geiger-Marsden Observation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Their observation found:

        $$p(\text{backscattering})\approx 10^{-4}$$

      \item This is much larger than expected

      \item Rutherford proposed that the charge and mass of atoms are concentrated in a region called the nucleus

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Bohr Model

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Proposed by Niels Bohr (1913)

      \item Atoms resembled a miniature planetary system

        \begin{figure}[h!]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/BModel}
          \caption{The Bohr Model}
          \label{fig:2}
        \end{figure}

      \item From this, the Coulomb interaction (force) was determined:

        $$\boxed{F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}}$$

      \item The kinetic energy was determined as:

        $$\boxed{K=\frac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{e^2}{r}}$$

      \item If the electron is radiating, it slows down and moves toward nucleus to collapse?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Niels Bohr hypothesized that electrons may exist in ``stationary states'' without radiating electromagnetic energy

        \end{itemize}

      \item $L = rp = rmv = n\hbar \rightarrow v = \frac{n\hbar}{mr}$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $L$ is the angular momentum, $r$ is the radius, n is a quantized number, and $m$ is the mass

        \end{itemize}

      \item Substituting this into kinetic energy, we get the permitted radius, $r$:

        $$\boxed{r_n=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_o\hbar^2}{me^2}n^2}$$

      \item Using electron information, we get:

        $$\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_o\hbar^2}{me^2}=.0529[\si{\nano\meter}]$$

      \item This value is known as the Bohr radius

    \end{itemize}

  \item Hydrogen Atom and Bohr Model:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Radius: $r_n=a_on^2,\quad\quad n=1,2,3$

      \item Energy: $E_n=\frac{-13.6[\si{\eV}]}{n^2}$

      \item $\Delta E = E_n - E_1$ is the excitation energy, where $E_n$ is the nth excited state, and $E_1$ is the ground state

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $|E_n|$ is the binding energy of $e^-$ in state $n$ (ionization energy)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Optical transitions\footnote{Transitions using a photon}  result in absorption or emission of a photon

        \begin{itemize}

          \item In stationary state, there is no electromagnetic energy radiation

          \item $e^-$ can emit radiation when moving from $n_1$ to $n_2$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Line Spectra}

  \item The absorption or emission from atoms may be used to create an emission spectra

  \item A general equation was generated:

    $$\boxed{\lambda=\lambda_{\text{limit}}\dfrac{n^2}{n^2-n_o^2},\quad\quad n=n_o+1,n_o+2,\cdots}$$

  \item For the Balmer series, $n_o=2$

  \item For the Lyman series, $n_o=1$
    
  \item The Ritz combination principle:

    $$f_1+f_2=f_3$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This principle shows that the sum of any two emission frequencies results in a frequency that is also in the spectrum

    \end{itemize}

  \item The wavelength of the transition becomes:

    $$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}=\dfrac{64\pi^3\varepsilon_o^2\hbar^3c}{me^4}\dfrac{n_1^2n_2^2}{n_1^2-n_2^2}=\dfrac{1}{R_{\infty}}\dfrac{n_1^2n_2^2}{n_1^2-n_2^2}$$

  \item Where $R_{\infty}$ is the Rydberg constant, equal to $1.097\cdot10^7 [\si{\per\meter}]$

  \item Lyman series are only observed in the absorption spectrum

  \item The following summarizes emission spectra

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Isolated atoms are in the ground state most of the time

      \item Excited state lives fro a short time (picoseconds to femtoseconds)

      \item The absorption spectrum only occurs from the ground state

      \item Balmer series are not found in the absorption spectrum

    \end{itemize}

    \section{The Bohr Model}

  \item For an atom with $z>1$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item For a nucleus of charge $ze$, the Coulomb force is:

        $$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}=\frac{ze^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_o r^2}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
