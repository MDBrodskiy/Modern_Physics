    \section{Basic Properties of Atoms}

  \item Around 1900, knowledge about atoms was:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Size: Small, $1[\si{\angstrom}]/.1[\si{\nano\meter}]$

      \item Stable: Forces balance

      \item Atoms contain electrons ($e^-$) and maintain neutral charge

      \item Atoms can emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation

    \end{itemize}

  \item An early atom model: J.J. Thomson (1904):

      \label{fig:1}
    \end{figure}

  \item Rutherford discovered two rays, $\alpha$ and $\beta$-rays, which he used to experiment with atoms

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\alpha$ rays are essentially \ce{He^2+} atoms

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The positive charge would mean that the atoms should deflect $\alpha$ rays

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Geiger-Marsden Observation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Their observation found:

        $$p(\text{backscattering})\approx 10^{-4}$$

      \item This is much larger than expected

      \item Rutherford proposed that the charge and mass of atoms are concentrated in a region called the nucleus

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Bohr Model

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Proposed by Niels Bohr (1913)

      \item Atoms resembled a miniature planetary system

        \begin{figure}[h!]

          \label{fig:2}
        \end{figure}

      \item From this, the Coulomb interaction (force) was determined:

        $$\boxed{F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}}$$

      \item The kinetic energy was determined as:

        $$\boxed{K=\frac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{e^2}{r}}$$

      \item If the electron is radiating, it slows down and moves toward nucleus to collapse?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Niels Bohr hypothesized that electrons may exist in ``stationary states'' without radiating electromagnetic energy

        \end{itemize}

      \item $L = rp = rmv = n\hbar \rightarrow v = \frac{n\hbar}{mr}$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $L$ is the angular momentum, $r$ is the radius, n is a quantized number, and $m$ is the mass

        \end{itemize}

      \item Substituting this into kinetic energy, we get the permitted radius, $r$:

        $$\boxed{r_n=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_o\hbar^2}{me^2}n^2}$$

      \item Using electron information, we get:

        $$\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_o\hbar^2}{me^2}=.0529[\si{\nano\meter}]$$

      \item This value is known as the Bohr radius

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
