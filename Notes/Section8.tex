    \section{The Hydrogen Molecule}

  \item How the wave function interaction binds the atoms together in a molecular shell

  \item Two possible wave functions between two same-charge particles:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $|\psi_1+\psi_2|^2$: Relatively large in the region between the two protons

      \item $|\psi_1-\psi_2|^2$: No density midway between the two protons

    \end{itemize}

  \item $\psi_1+\psi_2$ is a bonding state

  \item $\psi_1-\psi_2$ is an anti-bonding state

  \item Bonding in Molecules:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Covalent Bonding â€” Share electrons, occupation of bonding states lower the energy of the molecule

      \item Ionic Bonding

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
