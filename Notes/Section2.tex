\begin{itemize}

    \section{Review of Electromagnetic Waves}

  \item Reviewing the nature of light (or electromagnetic waves)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A plane wave

        \begin{itemize}

          \item A plane wave traveling in the positive x direction:

            $$\left\{\begin{array}{c} \vec{E}=\vec{E}_o\sin(kx-\omega t)\\\vec{B}=\vec{B}_o\sin(kx-\omega t) \end{array}$$

            \item The direction of energy transport would be $\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$

            \item $|\vec{E}|$ and $|\vec{B}|$ are constant at a given $t$

            \item The power, $P$, of the wave:

              $$P=\frac{E}{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{\mu_oc}E_o^2A\sin^2(kx-\omega t)$$

            \item Two important features:

              \begin{enumerate}

                \item Intensity (average power per unit area) is proportional to $E_o^2$

                  $$P_{avg}=\int_0^T P(t)\,dt$$

                \item  The intensity of the system fluctuates with time

                  $$\frac{P_{avg}}{A}$$

              \end{enumerate}

        \end{itemize}

      \item A spherical wave

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Spreads out uniformly along the three axis

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \section{The Photoelectric Effect}

  \item Experiment performed by Heinrich Hertz (1887)

  \item When a metal surface is illuminated, light electrons can be emitted from the surface

  \item The Experiment:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Connect emitter and collector to an external circuit

      \item Apply a negative potential to the circuit collector

      \item Increase the potential difference ($(-V)-(+V)$) to be more negative

      \item At some point, even the most energetic electrons do not have enough kinetic energy to reach the collector

      \item The maximum kinetic energy to reach the collector with the stopping voltage, $V_s$, is:

        $$K_{max}=eV_s$$

    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The classical picture: The energy of light with intensity $I$ is absorbed by electrons, $E_{light} > E_{binding}$, $e$ is released


      \item What does the classical wave theory predict?

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item $K_{max}$ is proportional to $E_o^2\rightarrow\boxed{I}$

          \item The effect occurs for light with any frequency or wavelength

          \item $e^-$ are released

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
