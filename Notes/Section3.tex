\begin{itemize}

    \section{De Broglie's Hypothesis}

  \item After Einstein's theory, it was determined that light has dual particle-wave nature

  \item In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposes a hypothesis:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Any object moving with a momentum $p$ is associated with a wave of wavelength $\lambda$, where:

        $$\boxed{\lambda=\frac{h}{p}}$$

      \item $\lambda$ refers to the ``De Broglie'' wavelength, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $p$ is the momentum

      \item For experimental measurement of the wave--like behavior of particles, the double and single-slit experiments were performed

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Experimental Evidence for De Broglie Waves}

  \item Particle Diffraction Experiment

    \begin{itemize}

      \item For light of wavelength $\lambda$ incident on a slit of width $a$, the diffraction pattern has a minimum at angles:

        $$\boxed{a\sin(\theta)=n\lambda,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, n=1,2,3,\cdots}$$

      \item Each of the atoms acts as a scatter

      \item The scattered electron waves interfere

      \item The crystal serves as a diffraction grating

      \item The maxima occurs at angle:

        $$\boxed{d\sin(\phi)=n\lambda}$$

      \item Where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength

    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Double-Slit Experiment}

  \item Question: Through which slit does the particle pass?

  \item Result: No diffraction pattern on the screen

  \item if we check which slit the particle passes through:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Particle behavior is measured

      \item We can not observe its wave nature simultaneously! (Principle of complementarity)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Conclusion: 

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The electron will behave as a wave or a particle

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Heisenberg Uncertainty Relationships}

  \item Applying the uncertainty relationship to de Broglie waves:

    $$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}\Rightarrow dp=-\frac{h}{\lambda^2}\,d\lambda\Rightarrow \Delta p = \frac{h}{\lambda^2}\Delta\lambda$$

  \item Finally, this yields:

    $$\Delta x\Delta p\approx \varepsilon h$$

  \item From quantum mechanics:

    $$\Delta x\Delta p\geq\frac{h}{4\pi}$$

    $$\varepsilon=\frac{1}{4\pi}$$

    $$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{1}{2}\hbar$$

  \item Where $\hbar=\dfrac{h}{2\pi}$

  \item When a coin is flipped, or a dice is rolled:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item No way to predict a single flip/roll

      \item But, we can predict the distribution of the results from a large \# of flips or rolls

      \item Quantum Theory allows for the same behavior

    \end{itemize}
    
  \item Wave Function

    \begin{itemize}

      \item What is the amplitude of the de Broglie wave?

      \item Checking classical waves:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Waves in the ocean: Height of water level

          \item Sound wave: Volume density of molecules

          \item Light waves: $\overrightarrow{E},\overrightarrow{B}$ field

          \item de Broglie waves: The probability of finding a particle at a given $(x,t)$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item This is known as $\psi$, the wave function

              \item In $n$-dimensional space, it becomes $\psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n,t)$

              \item In classical physics, the intensity ($I$) of any wave is proportional to $|A|$

              \item For quantum mechanics, we have the probability of final particle $P\propto |\psi|^2$

            \end{itemize}

          \item The requirement for wave function $\psi$ is that $|\psi|^2\geq0$

          \item Any physical measurement is related to $P\propto |\psi|^2$

          \item $\psi$ are generally complex \#'s

          \item Properties of Complex Numbers

            \begin{itemize}

              \item $\psi = Re(\psi) + iIm(\psi)$

              \item The complex conjugate is: $\psi^* = Re(\psi) - iIm(\psi)$

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item In the complex plane:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The phase factor is $\boxed{z=|z|e^{i\theta}}$

      \item The wave function of a free particle is $Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)}$ or $A[\cos(kx-\omega t)+i]sin(kx-\omega t)]$
        
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
