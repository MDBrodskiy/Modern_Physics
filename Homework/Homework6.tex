    \section*{Permitted Wave Functions}

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item One reason why this function is not permitted is because it violates the normalization condition, $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi(x)|^2\,dx=1$; more specifically, solving for the boundary conditions makes it violate this:

        $$A\cos(kx)=B\sin(kx)$$
        $$A\cos(0)=B\sin(0)$$
        $$A=0$$

        Differentiating to find $B$:

        $$0=Bk\cos(kx)$$
        $$B=0$$

        Because both constants are zero, the integral over the entire boundary does not equal 1.

      \item $\psi(x)=\dfrac{Ae^{-kx}}{x}$ can not be a solution because it is discontinuous; at the point $x=0$, the function has a discontinuity.

      \item $A\sin^{-1}(kx)$ can not be a solution because it is discontinuous. $\sin^{-1}$ is only valid for values in the range $\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{2}, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$, and, thus, it must have a discontinuity somewhere in its domain, unless $k$ where to have the value of zero; in such a case, the function would violate the normalization condition, as it would be zero over its whole domain.

      \item $A\tan(kx)$ can not be a solution because it is discontinuous every $n\pi$ values.
